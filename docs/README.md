# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This directory centralizes OctoAcme project management processes, templates, and best practices. It converts tacit team knowledge into versioned, searchable artifacts so every team member—new or tenured—can execute projects consistently and confidently.

OctoAcme applies an iterative, transparency-first delivery model. Work flows from opportunity intake and project initiation through structured planning, disciplined execution & tracking, risk and dependency management, release readiness, and retrospective learning. Each phase has lightweight checklists that reinforce shared expectations (definition of ready / definition of done), reduce rework, and ensure quality. Continuous improvement is built in: insights from retrospectives, production incidents, and stakeholder feedback feed updates to these living documents.

Clear roles anchor accountability. The Product Lead owns problem framing, prioritization, and outcome definition. The Project Manager (PM) stewards scope, timelines, risk surfacing, and cross-team coordination. Developers and QA co-own solution design, implementation quality, test coverage, and release confidence. Stakeholders provide domain input and validate alignment with strategic goals. Collaboration is facilitated by a single source of truth in this repository—issues capture decisions and changes; docs explain why processes exist and how to apply them.

Communication is structured and purposeful: kickoff establishes context and success criteria; weekly (or sprint) status updates highlight progress, blockers, and emerging risks; targeted risk reviews and escalation paths prevent silent drift; demo sessions promote transparency and early validation; release readiness checkpoints confirm compliance with QA, deployment, and rollback standards; retrospectives transform lessons learned into documented improvements. Quality assurance practices span proactive planning (checklists, acceptance criteria), ongoing validation (automated + exploratory testing), and post-release review. This closed feedback loop drives higher reliability over time.

## Purpose of This Copilot Space
- Centralize scattered project management knowledge
- Standardize and refine workflows collaboratively
- Provide equal access to processes, decisions, and rationale
- Accelerate onboarding; reduce single-person dependency risk
- Enable consistent, repeatable execution and continuous improvement

## Contributing & Improvements
To propose changes: open a new issue using the appropriate template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Reference affected files and articulate the rationale (gap, clarity, inconsistency, or new learning). After review, approved changes are merged and this README or related docs are updated accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria for Future README Updates
- [ ] Content aligns with existing process docs
- [ ] Improves clarity or closes a documented gap
- [ ] Reviewed with relevant stakeholders when necessary

Closes #2
